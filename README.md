    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Build Docker images for services:**

    ```bash
    docker build -t your-docker-repo/data-service -f Dockerfile .
    # Repeat for other services if necessary
    ```

5. **Deploy the infrastructure using Terraform:**

    ```bash
    cd terraform
    terraform init
    terraform plan
    terraform apply
    ```

6. **Deploy the services to Kubernetes:**

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f deployments/....yaml
    # Repeat for other service deployment files if necessary
    ```

   **OR run this command:**

    ```bash
    ./setup.sh
    ```

## Usage

### Running the bot

1. **Start the services locally:**

    ```bash
    python src/services/download_data.py
    # Repeat for other services if necessary
    ```

2. **Interact with the services using API endpoints:**

    Use tools like `curl` or Postman to interact with the API endpoints provided by your services.

    ```bash
    curl http://localhost:5000/download
    ```
